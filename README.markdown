My solutions to the [99 Haskell
Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions).

The file are structured according to the subpages on the Haskell wiki,
all randomness (e.g. 21-28 followed by 31-41) comes from that.

I usually come up with my own solution, then compare it to the ones in
the wiki. If I see anything I like, I make sure I understand how it
works and then incorporate it into my own solution.
